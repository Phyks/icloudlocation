iCloud to Nextcloud
===================

Apple iCloud "Find My" only lets you see your latest position, but sometimes
you want to scroll back in time and find previous positions. This scripts
autoamtically scrapes your iPhone location from iCloud and stores it in
Nextcloud, so that you get access to the full history.


## Installation

First, git clone and install required dependencies:

```bash
git clone â€¦
cd icloudlocation
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, set up the configuration:

```bash
cp config.example.ini config.ini
$EDITOR config.ini
```

Beware that your credentials will be stored in plaintext. You might want to
enable 2FA everywhere and only run it on a trusted machine/environment (disk
encryption, etc.). `cat`ing config in the following commands is here to help
you add an extra layer of security at rest (symmetric GPG, etc.) on your
config file (beware, secret data will still be available to anyone having
access to your files when your system is up).

For the Nextcloud part, you might want to use a dedicated access
token.


Run `icloud` program a first time to ensure everything is running smooth:

```bash
./.venv/bin/icloud --username apple_username
```

### Using 2FA

If you enabled 2FA on your Apple iCloud account, you can request the 2FA code
beforehand by :
If your device is online:
    Go to Settings > [your name].
    Tap Sign-In & Security > Two Factor Authentication.
    Tap Get Verification Code
If your device is offline: 
    Go to Settings > [your name].
    Tap Sign-In & Security.
    A message says "Account Details Unavailable." Tap Get Verification Code.
Put this 2FA code in the config.ini file, you have one minute to run the command line in the next section.



## Usage

```bash
cat config.ini | ./.venv/bin/python icloud_to_nextcloud.py
```

Use a `cron` daemon to run it periodically at the frequency of your choice.
